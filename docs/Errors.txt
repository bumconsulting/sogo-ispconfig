In this file you can read a bit about the different errors

let's see the errors/warnings are there to tell you that it is not running like it should
many of the errors or warnings will usually start like this Class-Name::Method-Name(): 
	- eg: error is raised "sogo_plugin::__sync_mail_users(): BLAH BLAH BLAH"
	- 		as you can see the error is raised by Class: "sogo_plugin" in function "__sync_mail_users()"
	-		followed by a small description of the error
	
in cases where the error is without "Class-Name::Method-Name():" 
it simply means that it is a "global" error or warning the could 
have bean set by any function/method this type of error/warning is 
never alone but raised along with another error/warning


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



sogo_plugin::__sync_mail_users(): unable to fetch the domain config for domain [example.dk]
	* when this error is raised and logged, it means the you DO NOT have configuration that can be used with this domain
	* this is usually followed by a warning (NOT AN ERROR) from "sogo_helper::get_domain_config()"



sogo_helper::get_domain_config(): failed. Unable to get server config from domain example.dk
	* when this warning is raised and logged, it simply means that the server were SOGo is installed and the plugin is running
	* do not have ANY configuration that can be used to set up the configuration(s)!
	* one could say that it should not be raised but then don't install the plugin on that server!
	


SOGo get server config failed
	* when this error is raised and logged, it simply means that there is NO server configuration that can be used
	* and it is called from multiple different methods so no "Class-Name::Method-Name():"

Why do i see these errors in ispconfig/cron.log

2014-10-18 15:21:03.014 sogo-tool[7517] No folder returned for user 'admin@example.dk'
	*simply output from calling "sogo-tool" when deleting a mail user, it's not an error 
	
2014-10-18 15:21:02.847 sogo-tool[7517] ERROR(+[GCSFolderManager defaultFolderManager]): default 'OCSFolderInfoURL' is not configured.
	* this one is only logged the second the plugin tries to operate anything with SOGo, it means (simply) that you are missing the OCSFolderInfoURL (SQL connection)
	* eg. deleting a mail user, rebuilding the configuration, restarting SOGo etc..
