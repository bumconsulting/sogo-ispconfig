In this file you can read a bit about the different errors

let's see the errors/warnings are there to tell you that it is not running like it should
many of the errors or warnings will usually start like this Class-Name::Method-Name(): 
	- eg: error is raised "sogo_plugin::__sync_mail_users(): BLAH BLAH BLAH"
	- 		as you can see the error is raised by Class: "sogo_plugin" in function "__sync_mail_users()"
	-		followed by a small description of the error
	
in cases where the error is without "Class-Name::Method-Name():" 
it simply means that it is a "global" error or warning the could 
have bean set by any function/method this type of error/warning is 
never alone but raised along with another error/warning

	* when this error is raised and logged, it means the you DO NOT have configuration that can be used with this domain
	* this is usually followed by a warning (NOT AN ERROR) from "sogo_helper::get_domain_config()"



sogo_helper::get_domain_config(): failed. Unable to get server config from domain example.dk
	* when this warning is raised and logged, it simply means that the server were SOGo is installed and the plugin is running
	* do not have ANY configuration that can be used to set up the configuration(s)!
	* one could say that it should not be raised but then don't install the plugin on that server!
