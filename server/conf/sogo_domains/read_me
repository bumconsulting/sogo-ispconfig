for how to configure the config file and the format(XML Format) of the files see SOGo documentation
the file names must be as follow (must end with .conf)
they are not automaticly created you need to do this by hand.

a template for domain example.com wil be named.
example.com.conf

domains_default.conf :: default for all domains..

domains_server1.example.dk.conf :: default for domains on: server1.example.dk
